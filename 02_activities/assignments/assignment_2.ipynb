    "Working on Assignment 1 and 2 for the Algorithms and Data Structures course was engaging. The task involved creating a function to find all root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree. I started by understanding the problem and writing a clear plan. The input for the first test scenario was a tree with values `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]`, and the output was paths like `[1, 2, 3]`. Implementing the function using Depth-First Search (DFS) was straightforward, and it handled different tree structures effectively, as seen in the second scenario with input `[10, 9, 7, 8]`.\n",
